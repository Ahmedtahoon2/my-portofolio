## Products

### 1. Sonicrypt Device

The Sonicrypt Device is the world's first device that provides audio and visual confirmation of successful crypto payments. It aims to enhance the experience for both buyers and sellers involved in these transactions.

#### Features

- Audio confirmation of successful payments
- Visual confirmation of successful payments
- Voice confirmation of successful payments (Sonicrypt Plus & Sonicrypt Pro)
- Support for multiple wallets (Sonicrypt Plus & Sonicrypt Pro)
- Support for multiple blockchains (Sonicrypt Pro)
- Generate QR codes on-the-fly (Sonicrypt Pro)
- Off-chain transactions (Sonicrypt Pro)

#### Sonicrypt is powered by ESP32 microcontroller

#### User Workflow

1. The seller generates a QR code using the Sonicrypt app.
2. The buyer scans the QR code using their wallet app.
3. The buyer sends the payment to the seller.
4. The Sonicrypt device plays a sound and lights up when the payment is confirmed.
5. The seller provides the product to the buyer.
6. The transaction is complete.

#### How it Works

1. The Sonicrypt device connects to the blockchain network (Solana) websocket to listen for account changes.
2. It listens to changes in the seller's wallet address.
3. When a change is detected, it retrieves the last transaction signature.
4. It fetches the transaction details using the signature.
5. If the transaction is successful, the Sonicrypt device plays a sound and lights up.

### 2. Sonicrypt App

The Sonicrypt App is a mobile application that allows users to connect and configure their Sonicrypt devices. It serves as an interface for interacting with the device and managing aspects of the crypto transaction process.
