## MDX

With Nextra, all your `.mdx` files under the pages directory will be rendered
with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about), it's an advanced Markdown format with React
component support.

For example, you can use import and use React components inside your Markdown
files like this:

```jsx filename="Markdown"
## Hello MDX

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {children}
      {count}
    </button>
  );
}

<Counter>**Clicks**: </Counter>
```

Besides basic MDX, Nextra also has some advanced Markdown features built-in.
